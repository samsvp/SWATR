# Re: SWAT
A game for the brackeys game jam where you are a SWAT member that can rewind time. Go back in time and deal with rescue hostage situations, lawbreakers, bankroberies and more. 
The main goal is to rescue all hostages and take care of any hostile enemy non lethaly (although not always possible).
While rewinding time, the possition and status(injured, dead, alive) of the people around you will go back in time, but your location and available resources won't refil or change.
